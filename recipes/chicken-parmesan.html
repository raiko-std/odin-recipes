    <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>

    <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
    <img src="../img/parmesan3.webp" width="200">
    <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>

    <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
    <img src="../img/parmesan5.webp" width="200">
    <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>

    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
    <img src="../img/parmesan7.webp" width="200">
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
    <img src="../img/parmesan8.webp" width="200">
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
  <p>Use high-quality prepared tomato sauce for a better result. You may substitute pesto or dried Italian herbs of your choice for basil or omit entirely.</p>
